# AccountManagerEncrytion
C++ Account Manager

Program that allows users to create an account that is saved an encrypted in users.txt. Users can also message other users as well as control the state of their account. There is also a root user feature that has control over all other users. (username: root, password: root).

To use copy these files onto your system. Type 'make' to compile everything and type 'run' to execute.
Currently this program only runs through a command line interface, but soon I will be uploading a version with a GUI.
